## My goals

Computer science and robotics have the power to uplift and equalize, if used responsibly.  I firmly believe that it falls to us, as computer scientists and roboticists, to use these disciplines to their fullest potential for social good.  I hope to join your family of service-minded experts to discover and contribute to the best avenues of doing so.

Read below to see how my research and academic experiences have positioned me to succeed in industry and motivated me to pursue social equity.

## Undergraduate student at Northwestern University

While studying mechanical engineering for my undergraduate, I focused my efforts on philanthropic uses for STEM, and nurtured a growing interest in computer science.  My work mentoring incarcerated high school students in digital music showed me how digital tools can delight, bring hope to, and materially aid people who are marginalized.  Entering the CS research environment for an NSF REU, I grappled with data collection, 3D computer vision using compound video sources, and particle cloud tracking.  I eagerly cultivated skills in these topics, proactively asking faculty about the traits of various 3D sensors and formulating computer vision algorithms with my peers.  By the end of that experience, I had developed the beginning of a computer vision library for tracking the position and orientation of a rat head in 3D space, selected an appropriate 3D sensor for that project, and co-built an experiment to track dense clouds of bubbles for flow visualization.  Simultaneously, I designed and taught a project-based course in robotics as a lab outreach program, and began to TA a similar course.  On the tail of an invigorating REU experience, I chose to continue my computational work professionally, while focusing on directly helping others.

## KID Museum

To this end, I joined KID Museum, a DC-area STEM education nonprofit for elementary and middle school students.  there, I gave one-on-one Python and Raspberry Pi classes, as well as hands-on group lessons in NLP, Arduino, Micro Bit, Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, and machine theory.  I steered our educational content toward socially conscious coding workshops, such as emotional wellness apps and contagion models, to help students better process the experience of living in a pandemic.  I used a steady flow of personal projects to inspire students, including a tic-tac-toe AI, an evolution simulator, and a program to protect peaceful protesters by translating jargon on legal police scanners.  Throughout this work, I helped children take control of the programmable world around them.  However, my drive for computational sophistication and social reach outgrew KID Museum's scope, so I began a graduate program in computer science.

## Graduate student at George Mason University

Now, I am undergoing a computer science MS with an emphasis on machine learning, robotics, and graphics, so that I can develop more intricate and impactful solutions for social problems.  Currently I am working as a paid research assistant in the INSPIRED Lab of Dr. Brittany Johnson, where we are developing a tool to improve the ease of debugging machine learning models, including removing unethical biases from models deployed in social contexts.  At the same time, I am satisfying my interests in robotics for social good by volunteering in the DCXR Lab of Dr. Lap-Fai (Craig) Yu, where we are collaborating with another lab to create a teleoperated robot that can be used in search-and-rescue contexts.

## Search for a post-graduation career

I hope to join a team that uses technology to make the world a more equitable place.  I plan to use my mixture of backgrounds in computer science, robotics, and mechanical engineering to enhance my work.  My background in education has taught me how to aid and enrich others, both colleagues and end-users.
