# Directed energy deposition cooling jet

## Summary

I worked on a team of seven engineers consulting for the Advanced Manufacturing Processes Laboratory (AMPL) at Northwestern University.  We designed a programmable device to more effectively cool parts being built by a directed-energy deposition machine.  The machine, shown below, fabricates parts by spraying a metal powder which is then sintered into place by a laser.

We developed a cooling jet system with an active feedback system including automatic aiming and flow control.  Our cooling system continuously adjusts the position and intensity of the jet to optimize thermal uniformity throughout the fabricated part, improving its material properties.

To expedite our iteration time, I developed a heat transfer simulator in MATLAB, with which we could filter our prototype ideas for effectiveness before building them.

## Skills gained

Through this project, I gained vital experience in writing academic-grade physical simulation software for industrial purposes, as well as in feedback control system design and materials selection.  Furthermore, the process of consulting for a large laboratory allowed me to grow in my ability to fulfill the differing needs of many clients on a large project.
