# Breadboard holder rack

## Summary

As someone who does a lot of electronics prototyping both professionally and as a hobby, it can be hard to keep all my breadboards organized.  I designed a freestanding breadboard rack for public use, so that breadboards can be categorized more efficiently and stored more compactly.  I also performed a stress analysis simulation to ensure that the stand would remain strong even while holding particularly laden breadboards.

## Skills gained

This project gave me a fun opportunity to dust off some of my mechanical engineering expertise, particularly in creating trusses that are both materially efficient and elegant.
