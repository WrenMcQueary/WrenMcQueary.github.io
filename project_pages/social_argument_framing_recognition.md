<h2>Social argument framing recognition</h2>

### Summary

In social science, there is a widely-accepted list of 15 cross-cutting framing dimensions.  To argue a point about a social issue, one must typically use at least one of these frames.  The framing dimensions are shown below.

I built a large language model to identify framing dimensions used in news articles and opinion pieces about social issues such as immigration and gay marriage.  I programmed the architecture for a transformer model from scratch and trained it on data that I hand-gathered.

### Skills gained

Through building this project, I learned how transformer models are designed and how their architectures have been so explosively popular in recent years.  I also gained some experience in gathering large amounts of data from the internet using a combination of automated webscraping and manual approaches.
