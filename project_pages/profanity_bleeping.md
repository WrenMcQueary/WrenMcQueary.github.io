# Profanity bleeping

TODO: GitHub repository button

## Summary

I sometimes find educational videos that would be perfect to show for a class or workshop I'm running, only to discover that they contain expletives.  I made this program to automatically bleep out curse words from an audio sample.

This project requires setting up an account with Google Cloud API for speech recognition; as a result it unfortunately cannot be turned into a live Replit demonstration.

## Skills gained

I learned how to use Google Cloud API to process audio remotely, as well as how to use the third-party Python package called wave to process audio locally.

Because audio processing can sometimes take a while, I learned how to use the tqdm package to provide the user with a progress bar.
