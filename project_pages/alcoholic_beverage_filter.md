# Alcoholic beverage filter

## Summary

As commission work for a team of materials scientists at University of Minnesota, I produced a 3D model and photorealistic renders of the winning product of the winter 2022 UMN Crucible Competition.  The product, an alcoholic beverage filter, uses selective adsorbent technology to remove carbonyl compounds (such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) from low-price alcoholic beverages for safer consumption.

## Skills gained

While hardly my first time modeling in Fusion 360, this was my first time producing a photorealistic render with the software.  I learned to manipulate and tile bump-map texture patterns, as well as adjust lighting angle and color temperature.

Since this was commission work, I had the opportunity to practice maintaining a positive client relationship while providing a final product to their exact specifications with a rapid turnaround.
